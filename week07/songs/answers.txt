If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
how would you characterize their audio aura?
Popular, not unique

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very
representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would
you propose?
A better way of calculating his aura would be to get the energy, loudness,
valence, spechiness, etc of all the songs
